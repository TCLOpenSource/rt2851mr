==========================================================================================
	Note (Please read):

	At decoder filter init time, 2 ringbuffers are inited with type of STREAM and COMMAND
	If parsing will be used, 3rd ringbuffer needs to be inited with type of MESSAGE

	The inband commands are issued in the command segment, each segment begins with NEW_SEG,
	end with EOS:
	([] means optional):
		----------
		NEW_SEG
		----------
		[OUTPUT_FMT]
		[PTS_SKIP]
		DECODE
		----------
		[PTS]
		[SEQ_END]
		[CONTEXT]
		----------
		EOS
		----------
	System can issue one or more command segments. Decoder will finish decoding one segment
	before decoding the new one. Decoding may be stopped in 2 ways:
	1. decode is finished (PTSDuration is finished)
	2. EOS is reached.
	Otherwise, decoder will wait for more bistream and bistream commands (PTS, SEQ_END, CONTEXT).

	System must issue all bistream commands before updating ring buffer write point to avoid
	racing condition.

	Deocoder needs to mantain a SegNum. SegNum = 0 when decoder is created, increated by one after
	each EOS. Decoder needs to attach SegNum in the 1st ouput frame/field and EOS in the last ouput
	frame/field in this segment.

	Decoder also needs to attach both PTS and RPTS (RelativePTS) to the decoded picture for system
	to retrive from VOUT when they are displayed.

	Decoder needs to attach EOS with the integer passed by NEW_SEG by system to the last decoded field/frame.

/** Video Mixer Inband APIs */
/**
	  This spec defines a set of API to send command via cmd fifo.
		Inband command is passed through inband cmd fifo. Each command
		is contained in INBAND_CMD_PKT. Once the system software
		push a INBAND_CMD_PKT in the cmd fifo, it should then update
		the write pointer. System software should take the responsibility
		to keep the cmd fifo from overflow.
	==========================================================================================
	Note (Please read):

	Video Mixer is filter with 2 input pins and one output pin. Its inputs are connected to 2 decoders
	and its output is connected to a VOUT or a Video Encoder.

	Video mixer operation is very simple, it does not have run, stop, or pause. It only have 3 inband commands:
	SET_BG_COLOR, SET_MIXER_RPTS and BLEND.

	SET_BG_COLOR sets background color but it does not cause an action.
	SET_MIXER_RPTS sets mixer relative PTS. All the future BLEND command refer to this RPTS.

	BLEND is the only command that causes actions: blend 1 or 2 stream(s) and/or background
	and send the output video to output pin. Mixer RPTS is counted with mixer output.

	If (alphaA + alphaB) =< 255, A and B will be blended and then blended with backgraoud with (1-alphaA-alphaB).
	If (alphaA + alphaB) > 255, this command will be discarded (illegal command)

	BlendMode selects A only, B only and AB blend.
	For A only mode, only stream A buffer is dequeued and blened with backgroud color if alphaA is not 255.
	For B only mode, only stream B buffer is dequeued and blened with backgroud color if alphaA is not 255.
	For AB only mode, both stream A and stream B buffers are dequeued and blened with backgroud color if (alphaA+alphaB)<255.

	Implementation notes:

	1. Mixte maintains 3 variables: MixerRPTS, OffsetA, OffsetB
		- RPTS is 0 when created
		- OffsetA is updated at the beginning of BlendA or BlendAB command, if the first field/frame of streamA has NEW_SEG mark:
			OffsetA = DecoderRPTSA - MixerRPTS
		- OffsetB is updated at the beginning of BlendB or BlendAB command, if the first field/frame of streamB has NEW_SEG mark:
			OffsetB = DecoderRPTSB - MixerRPTS

	2. MixerPTS is updated in the following cases:
		- When SET_MIXER_RPTS is processed, MixerRPTS is updated by this command.
		- When a field or frame is ouputed, MixerRPTS is updated to: (TargetDecoderRPTS - Offset of that stream)
		- When a blend command is finished (PTSDuration is reached), MixterRPTS is updated to the endingPTS.
			endingPTS is calculated before blending is excuted: endingPTS = MixerPTS + PTSDuration.

	3. A and B each has a receive queue of 2 frames or 4 fields: QA[2] and QB[2]

	3. Blending command may be implemented this way (use top field as example, bot field is the same):

		endingPTS = MixterPTS + PTSDuration;

		switch (blendMode)
		{
		    case A:
		    	if (QA[0].NEW_SEG) OffsetA = QA[0].RPTS - MixerPTS;
			while (1){
			    if ( QA[0].alphaA == 255) output QA[0];
			    else mix (QA[0], BG);
			    MixterPTS = QA[0].RPTS-OffsetA;
			    if (QA[0].EOS) break;
			    QA[0]=QA[1];QA[1]=NULL ( Move QA[1] to QA[0], decoder will fill QA[1] with a new field )
			    if (QA[0].NEW_SEG || QA[0].RPTS-offsetA > endingPTS) {
			    	MixterPTS = endingPTS;
			    	break;
			    }
			}
		    case B:
			if (QB[0].NEW_SEG) OffsetB = QB[0].RPTS - MixerPTS;
			while (1){
			    if ( QB[0].alphaA == 255) output QB[0];
			    else mix (QB[0], BG);
			    MixterPTS = QB[0].RPTS-OffsetA;
			    if (QB[0].EOS) break;
			    QB[0]=QB[1]; QB[1]=NULL; ( Move QB[1] to QB[0], decoder will fill QB[1] with a new field )
			    if (QB[0].NEW_SEG || QB[0].RPTS-offsetA > endingPTS) {
